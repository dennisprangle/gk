# Version 0.4.0 (2nd Feb 2017)

* Complete rewrite to make code more efficient and stable. This involves changes to the argument required by the functions.

* Added support for the generalised g-and-h distribution.

* Parameter validity can be checked with isValid now rather than check.params.

* gk.MLE and order statistics functions removed. Improve inference functions will appear in the next version.
